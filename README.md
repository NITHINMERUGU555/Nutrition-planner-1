# Nutrition-planner

## Project Overview

Nutrition Planner is a clean, modular, and fully responsive website built with PHP, designed to help users plan meals, browse healthy recipes, and track daily nutrition seamlessly. 

The project emphasizes PHP-based modular architecture with reusable components like headers and footers, enabling easier maintenance and consistent site-wide navigation. It features semantic HTML5 markup and CSS3 for accessible and visually appealing layouts that adapt well across devices.

Developed as a personal portfolio piece, Nutrition Planner demonstrates practical use of PHP includes, server-side rendering, and effective front-end styling to deliver a user-friendly, content-focused experience without client-side scripting.
